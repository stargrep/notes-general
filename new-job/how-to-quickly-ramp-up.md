Quick note for quickly ramp up

1. smaller diff.
good for you, good for me.

2. write a good design doc then implement it, less refactor.
design the class correct will save you a lot of time.


3. slow effectiveness, you need to be fast (productivity).
don't just code for coding, make sure shipping the product. 
APM is important, action per minute. Don't watch videos while working.

4. lower your ego. 
ask for help
keep code simple, not smarter!

5. make sure you know your manager and tech lead
TALK TO THEM BEFORE.

6. have a ramp up plan, reviewed by your manager and tech lead.
